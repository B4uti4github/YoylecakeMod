# 1.3.0
- God earned a well-deserved break after those first nine days, especially given the current state of the world right now. It was time for Jesus to learn how to walk on water by Himself. After spending 4 hours on a round-trip visit to the local merchant for alarm clock batteries (only to return to realize God had fully intended to take an extended break in the first place), Jesus got to work.
    - Jesus first started by giving additional credit where credit was due and left unmentioned the first time around. <cl>(Hey there, TheJosiahTurner!)</c>
    - Jesus also discovered how to detect disabled objects in levels--a common nusiance from earlier showcases of the Jesus mod on YouTube, as well as a frequent issue on GitHub. <cl>(He hopes His changes this time around should improve matters for a bit.)</c>
    - Jesus then consulted more experienced Geode modders to fix that one annoying crash that kept happening in the level editor for Windows and Android. <cl>(He wishes to thank [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for her counsel.)</c>
    - Jesus attempted to fix that other issue with scaled objects causing more appearances than usual. <cl>(Though He's unable to test His changes at 85% Acu, the level where the bug was first reported. Someone please teach Him about Start Position objects.)</c>
# 1.2.0
- And on the ninth day:
    - God could not play the bell sound effect consistently, so He took matters into His own hands. <cl>(And now there's a volume setting for it as well.)</c>
    - God also realized that the mod kept crashing in the level editor on Windows <cl>(and sometimes on Android), so He dropped support for it. (Level editor support in macOS is unaffected.)</c>
    - God also realized Jesus was a null texture on Android, and He decided to do something about it. <cl>(No more generic fallback texture!)</c>
    - God increased Jesus' picture quality by a tad smidge. <cl>(He was unable to pay the outrageous $14.50 USD fee Shutterstock demanded for the full quality image, and had to settle for less. Imagine if sales tax was included!)</c>
# 1.1.1
- God made a mistake with His function hooks.
# 1.1.0
- And on the eighth day God realized that Jesus wanted to be on macOS and Android; and he let Jesus do so on the eighth day.
- <cl>(Also, players can now choose how and when Jesus should appear, as well as what players hear when seeing Jesus.)</c>
# 1.0.3
- God fixed a few timing issues related to player (re)spawning.
# 1.0.2
- God noticed and fixed a possible node ID conflict.
# 1.0.1
- God decided to set default sensitivity setting to 2.
# 1.0.0
