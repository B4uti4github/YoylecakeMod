# 1.3.1
- Jesus was notified by one of his disciples that no one could change His appearance in-game.
    - It had turned out that there was some weird behavior going on without His proper knowlegde, so He corrected that. <cy>He would like to apologize to anyone who had trouble changing His appearance in-game.</c>
- Jesus also learned that Geode was switching settings types, so He fixed that up real quick as well.
# 1.3.0
- God earned a well-deserved break after those first nine days, especially given the current state of the world right now. Even though Jesus learned of that news the hard way after spending four hours on a round-trip visit to the local merchant for alarm clock batteries, Jesus got to work.
    - Jesus first started by giving additional credit where credit was due and left unmentioned the first time around. <cl>(Hey there, TheJosiahTurner!)</c>
    - Jesus also learned how to detect disabled objects in levels--a common nusiance from earlier YouTube showcases of this mod, and a glaring issue on GitHub. <cl>(He hopes His changes this time around should improve matters for a bit.)</c>
    - Jesus then consulted more experienced Geode modders to fix that one annoying crash that kept happening in the level editor for Windows and Android. <cl>(He wishes to thank [hiimjasmine00](https://github.com/hiimjasmine00) for her counsel.)</c>
    - Jesus attempted to fix that other issue with sawblades causing more appearances than usual. <cl>(Unfortunately, He's unable to test His changes at 85% Acu, the level where the bug was first reported. Someone please teach Him about Start Position objects.)</c>
    - Jesus decided to add an option to show Himself when the player touches solid blocks. <cl>(He doesn't really recommend that you enable this, however.)</c>
# 1.2.0
- And on the ninth day:
    - God could not play the bell sound effect consistently, so He took matters into His own hands. <cl>(And now there's a volume setting for it as well.)</c>
    - God also realized that the mod kept crashing in the level editor on Windows <cl>(and sometimes on Android), so He dropped support for it. (Level editor support in macOS is unaffected.)</c>
    - God also realized Jesus was a null texture on Android, and He decided to do something about it. <cl>(No more generic fallback texture!)</c>
    - God increased Jesus' picture quality by a tad smidge. <cl>(He was unable to pay the outrageous $14.50 USD fee Shutterstock demanded for the full quality image, and had to settle for less. Imagine if sales tax was included!)</c>
# 1.1.1
- God made a mistake with His function hooks.
# 1.1.0
- And on the eighth day God realized that Jesus wanted to be on macOS and Android; and he let Jesus do so on the eighth day.
- <cl>(Also, players can now choose how and when Jesus should appear, as well as what players hear when seeing Jesus.)</c>
# 1.0.3
- God fixed a few timing issues related to player (re)spawning.
# 1.0.2
- God noticed and fixed a possible node ID conflict.
# 1.0.1
- God decided to set default sensitivity setting to 2.
# 1.0.0
- God created the Jesus mod.
